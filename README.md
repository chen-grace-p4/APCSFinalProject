Brief Project Description:
Our project will be a food-making game inspired by a combination of cooking fever, papaâ€™s pizzeria, and good pizza great pizza. It will consist of a minimum three levels of playing, each level with customers that come in and order food, a waiting time limit for each customer while the player makes the food, different stages for the food-making process, and finally giving the food to the customer. As the game progresses, more ingredients will be unlocked for cooking. A goal for money made must be reached each level to reach the next level. There will be a decreased money earned per order if the customer waits for too long, or the order is made incorrectly. Ideally, there will be multiple foods but for now we are focused on just making a pizzeria.

5-24 (class + home) Grace C: Made basic blueprints for Notepad, Things, Pizza, and Game. Coded very basic prototype of changing screens with the use of the main Fooderia file and a Game object.

5-24 (class+ home) Shriya A: Listed out the methods/ a brief description of their function for the main file to code later and tested out issues with having static vs non-static methods.

5-25 (home) Grace C: Fixed basic layout/color for screen changing and made it more efficient by creating a Buttons class. Completed most methods in pizza object (and added appropriate code in Fooderia and Game class) so that there is a very basic pizza making station in the "sauce" screen.

5-25 (home) Shriya A: Made the blueprint for the Customers Class; created the constructor and instance variables for said class along with some of the main methods such as those that return the variables, the show() method, move(), and customerComes() method. I added code for those methods to work in the main file under draw as well as in the Game class.
